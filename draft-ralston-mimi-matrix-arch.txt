1.  Introduction

   Matrix is an existing open standard for decentralized communication,
   suitable for Instant Messaging (IM), Voice over IP (VoIP) signaling,
   Internet of Things (IoT) communication, and bringing other existing
   communication platforms together.

   Though the existing Matrix specification as a whole (found online:
   [MxSpec]) is quite large, it is easily broken down into reusable
   specifications for simpler and more effective implementation.  This
   document serves to explore each of the existing specification's
   documents/APIs and how they relate to the More Instant Messaging
   Interoperability (MIMI) Working Group (WG), if at all, and cover the
   general architecture of Matrix.

   This document assumes some prior knowledge of federated or
   decentralized systems, such as the principles of electronic mail.
